# Vindinium Starter for C Sharp

The orginal version of this was by Mark Tanner and then put on github by ozten - ping them for his contact info. I have since significantly refactored it.

## How to run the example

The example is configured from `App.config`.

The keys expected in there are -
 - `key` - your Vindinium API key
 - `mode` - `training` or `arena`
 - `turns` - the number of turns (only used in training mode)
 - `uri` - what server to use - defaults to `http://vindinium.org/`
 - `map` - the vindinium map to use.
